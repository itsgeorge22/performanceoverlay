## FPS, Frametime & Benchmarking

**Performance Overlay** is a lightweight, client-side mod that shows **what actually matters for smooth gameplay** — not just average FPS.

It focuses on **1% / 0.1% lows, frametime stability, stutters, and frame spikes**, helping you understand *why* Minecraft feels smooth or laggy.

---

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The overlay updates in real time and displays:

- **FPS (average)**
- **1% low FPS**
- **0.1% low FPS**
- **Frametime**
- **Stutter count**
- **Worst frame spike**
- **GC pauses**
- **Memory usage**

All metrics are designed for **real performance analysis**, not vanity numbers.
